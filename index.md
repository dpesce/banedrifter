### Background

So I was initially [intrigued](https://xkcd.com/356/) by a cube that a friend showed me on [CubeCobra](https://cubecobra.com/).  It unfortunately appears to be the case that the original listing is no longer available, but the contents of the cube were very simple.  It consisted entirely of [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191065) and [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=145811), two classic cards that typically serve very different roles in decks.

![Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=191065&type=card "Baneslayer Angel")    ![Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=145811&type=card "Mulldrifter")

In the context of cube magic -- and of this cube in particular -- the question naturally arises: how should you draft from this cube?  I.e., what 40-card deck consisting exclusively of Baneslayer Angels, Mulldrifters, and basic lands is going to perform the best?  This repository represents my ongoing efforts to tackle these questions.
