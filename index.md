### Background

So I was initially [intrigued](https://xkcd.com/356/) by a cube that a friend showed me on [CubeCobra](https://cubecobra.com/).  It unfortunately appears to be the case that the original listing is no longer available, but the contents of the cube were very simple.  It consisted entirely of [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191065) and [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=145811), two classic cards that typically serve very different roles in decks.

![Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=191065&type=card "Baneslayer Angel")    ![Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=145811&type=card "Mulldrifter")

The Baneslayer-Mulldrifter dichotomy is one that gets invoked [a lot](https://luckypaper.co/podcast/110/) in the MTG community, often as archetypes of different styles of cards and interaction possibilities.  Both cards are 5-mana creatures, so they are superficially similar, but of course they have very different gameplay impacts and so are valuable in different kinds of environments.  The notion of whether one card can be "better" than the other is thus typically considered to be rather ill-posed, since the context in which they are played matters so much.

But I'm not interested in nuance; I just want answers.  And I'm willing to massively simplify the questions I'm asking in order to get those answers.  In the context of cube magic -- and of this Baneslayer+Mulldrifter cube in particular -- the question naturally arises: how should you draft from this cube?  I.e., what 40-card deck consisting exclusively of Baneslayer Angels, Mulldrifters, and basic lands is going to perform the best in an environment that only supports 40-card decks consisting exclusively of Baneslayer Angels, Mulldrifters, and basic lands?  This repository represents my ongoing efforts to tackle this and similar questions.
