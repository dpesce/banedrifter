Of course, even with our heavily restricted deck build, the decision-making process that constitutes perfect gameplay is far from obvious.  The idea behind the toolkit discussed in [the previous post](https://dpesce.github.io/banedrifter/2024/04/06/simulations.html) is that we can use it to explore different possible options for what this decision-making process might be and how it affects gameplay.

One computer-friendly approach to specifying how gameplay ought to happen is to come up with a comprehensive chain of logic by which each player is forced to abide, and then to encode that logic and simulate the resulting gameplay.  Moving forward, I'm going to refer to such a chain of logic as a "ruleset," and my plan is to try out a few of these rulesets to see what kinds of games they result in.

So let's start putting the simulation toolkit to work.

***

### Ruleset 01

For the first ruleset -- Ruleset 01 -- I am considering games in which players obey the following rules on every turn:

- If the player is able to play a land, then they will do so.
- If the player is able to play a Baneslayer Angel, then they will do so.
- If the player has no Baneslayer Angels in hand, but they have 5 mana open and a Mulldrifter, then they will usually play a Mulldrifter.  Exceptional cases include: when they have fewer than 2 cards remaining in their library.
- If the player has only 3 or 4 mana open and a Mulldrifter in hand, then they will usually evoke a Mulldrifter.  Exceptional cases include: when they have fewer than 2 cards remaining in their library.
- If the player is able to attack with a Baneslayer Angel, then they will do so.
- If the player is able to block a Baneslayer Angel with a Baneslayer Angel, then they will do so.
- The player never attacks or blocks with a Mulldrifter.
- If the player has to discard a card at the end of a turn, then they will preferentially discard the card that is most heavily-represented in their hand.  If one or more card types are tied for most heavily-represented, then the player will preferentially discard Tundra over Mulldrifter, and Mulldrifter over Baneslayer Angel.

Upon reading and digesting the above ruleset, one interesting exercise is to try to predict what kinds of outcomes games that follow this ruleset will have.  One potentially reasonable-sounding prediction might be:

> Well, because Mulldrifters can neither attack nor block, the only card that can win a game is Baneslayer Angel.  So given two decks with the same number of lands, the deck with more Baneslayer Angels will perform better.

Is this prediction correct?  We will eventually test it comprehensively, but let's first do some exploration of a single example matchup.

### Initial exploration: a single pairing

Consider two 40-card decks, each containing 17 copies of Tundra.  Player 1's deck will have 11 copies of Baneslayer Angel and 12 copies of Mulldrifter, while Player 2's deck will have 12 copies of Baneslayer Angel and 11 copies of Mulldrifter.  Using the above intuition, we would expect that Player 2 should win most often when both players are following Ruleset 01.  We can test this expectation by simulating gameplay between the two decks; let's simulate 10,000 games:

```
import banedrifter as bd
import rulesets as rs

# specify the number of games to simulate
N_games = 10000

# specify deck compositions
N_lands_player1 = 17
N_lands_player2 = 17
N_banes_player1 = 11
N_banes_player2 = 12
N_mulls_player1 = 40 - N_lands_player1 - N_banes_player1
N_mulls_player2 = 40 - N_lands_player2 - N_banes_player2

# play games in which Player 1 goes first
for i in range(N_games/2):
    d1 = bd.deck(N_banes_player1, N_mulls_player1, N_lands_player1)
    d2 = bd.deck(N_banes_player2, N_mulls_player2, N_lands_player2)
    p1 = bd.player(d1)
    p2 = bd.player(d2)
    p1, p2, winner, loss_reason = bd.play_game(p1,p2,
                                  cardplay_ruleset=rs.cardplay_01,
                                  combat_ruleset=rs.combat_01)

# play games in which Player 2 goes first
for i in range(N_games/2):
    d1 = bd.deck(N_banes_player1, N_mulls_player1, N_lands_player1)
    d2 = bd.deck(N_banes_player2, N_mulls_player2, N_lands_player2)
    p1 = bd.player(d1)
    p2 = bd.player(d2)
    p2, p1, winner, loss_reason = bd.play_game(p2,p1,
                                  cardplay_ruleset=rs.cardplay_01,
                                  combat_ruleset=rs.combat_01)
```

The results of these simulated games are summarized in the following plot:

![Matchup01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/single_matchup_01.png "Matchup01")

So the initial expectation seems to hold up, with Player 2 demonstrating a pretty decisive advantage and winning roughly 60% of all games.  But there's an interesting twist: the majority of the games are decided by milling, rather than by life total.  So the reason that Player 2 is winning most of the games is not because they have more Baneslayer Angels with which to reduce Player 1's life total, but rather because they have fewer Mulldrifters with which to mill themselves.

If milling is so prevalent in these games, then how do things change when we increase the deck size?  The plot below shows the results of another 10,000 simulated games in which each player's deck has been doubled in size, but with the proportions of each card maintained:

![Matchup02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/single_matchup_02.png "Matchup02")

Player 2 now wins roughly 70% of all games, and we can see that the relative contribution to each player's win rate from mill-based wins has substantially decreased.  However, Player 2 is still winning a majority of their games due to milling.  So how do things change as we continue to increase the deck size?  We can run some more simulations to find out:

![Deck size study](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/decksize_comparison_breakdown.png "Deck size study")

This plot is a bit busy, so let's walk through it.  The solid lines correspond to Player 1's wins, and the dashed lines correspond to Player 2's wins.  Red lines indicate wins by milling, blue lines indicate wins by life total, and gray lines indicate the overall win rate.  So for instance, if we look at the 40-card decks (all the way to the left of the plot), we can see that Player 1 has a ~40% overall win rate (solid gray line), with a bit more than 30% coming from mill-based wins (solid red line) and a bit less than 10% coming from life-total-based wins (solid blue line).  As the deck size increases, the win rates for both players stabilize at a bit below 50% for Player 1 and a bit above 50% for Player 2, with both players' win rates dominated by life-total-based wins.

So what's going on here?  How can we understand this initial rise and then fall of Player 2's win rate?

It seems to be the case that there are two regimes of relevance for these decks: a "small deck" regime in which the win rates are dominated by milling, and a "large deck" regime in which the win rates are dominated by life-total-based wins.  For Player 1's deck, the critical deck size at which it transitions from the small-deck regime to the large-deck regime is roughly 60 cards, while for Player 2 the analogous deck size is more like 90 cards.  As long as both decks are in the small-deck regime where the win rates are dominated by milling, then increasing the deck size has the effect of improving the performance of the less-mill-prone deck -- i.e., Player 2 performs better as deck size increases in this regime.  Conversely, once both decks are in the large-deck regime where the win rates are dominated by life-total-based wins, then increasing the deck size doesn't substantially change the win rates.

In the large-deck regime, we see that Player 2 wins roughly 51.3% of the time and that Player 1 wins roughly 48.7% of the time.  This difference in win rate -- about 2.6% -- almost exactly matches the 2.5% difference in the fractional number of Baneslayer Angels in each deck.  I.e., 12/40 = 30% of Player 2's deck is composed of Baneslayer Angels, while only 11/40 = 27.5% of Player 1's deck is.  It seems plausible that this 2.5% difference in the deck composition is what's driving the ~2.5% difference in win rates.  So here's a hypothesis: ***For any two decks following Ruleset 01, so long as both decks are operating in the large-deck regime then their relative win rates should match the relative fraction of each deck that is composed of Baneslayer Angels.***

Interestingly, it seems to be the case that for 40-card decks -- which are not generically in the large-deck regime -- we should expect a non-negligible fraction of games to be decided by milling.

### More extensive exploration: all 40-card decks running 17 lands

Now let's simulate more matchups.  Sticking momentarily with decks that are running 17 lands (all of which are Tundra), let's compare how all possible decks for Player 1 stack up against the same Player 2 deck as before (i.e., 12 copies of Baneslayer Angel and 11 copies of Mulldrifter):

![Winrate 1D, Nlands=17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/winrate_Nland=17_Nbane2=12.png "Winrate 1D, Nlands=17")

Here, the black curve indicates the overall win rate, with the blue and red curves showing how much of that win rate comes from life-total-based versus mill-based wins, respectively.  The highlighed red dot shows the mirror matchup, in which both decks are identical; as one would expect, the win rate for the mirror matchup is 50%.

We do see a grossly binary behavior for decks on either side of the mirror matchup: decks with more Baneslayer Angels than the mirror win more than 50% of the time, and decks with fewer Baneslayer Angels than the mirror win less than 50% of the time.  However, the win rate does not increase monotonically with the number of Baneslayer Angels in the deck.  Rather, it rises to a maximum win rate of about 92% when the deck contains 16 Baneslayer Angels but then starts decreasing, falling to a win rate of about 77% for a deck containing 23 Baneslayer Angels.  All decks containing 7 or more Baneslayer Angels predominantly win via milling.

Moving on to all 40-card decks running 17 lands, we can capture the space of matchups using a two-dimensional plot like so:

![Winrate 2D, Nlands=17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/winrate_2D__Nland=17.png "Winrate 2D, Nlands=17")

Each box in the grid here is colored according to the net win rate for Player 1 over 10,000 simulated games against Player 2, with each of the players wielding the decks indicated by the horizontal and vertical position of the grid cell, respectively.  A red color indicates a win rate above 50%, a blue color indicates a win rate below 50%, and white indicates a 50% win rate.  Given the setup of the horizontal and vertical axes, the mirror matches fall along the diagonal.  The yellow lines overlaid on the grid are contours of constant win rate for Player 1; the bottommost contour corresponds to a 90% win rate, and each consecutive contour above it corresponds to a win rate that is 10% lower than that of the previous contour.

To determine the best-performing deck, we need to find the average win rate of each deck across all of its possible matchups.  Each row or column in the colored grid above corresponds to an appropriate set of matchups for averaging, so I've just chosen to average the columns.  The topmost panel in the figure then shows the results of these averages, which correspond to the overall win rates for each deck as a function of how many Baneslayer Angels it contains.  After averaging over all games, we find that ***the best-performing deck is the one that runs 21 Baneslayer Angels and 2 Mulldrifters.***  This deck achieves an overall win rate of about 79.2%, which is better by roughly 1.5% than the deck that just blindly runs 23 Baneslayer Angels.

So at least for the limited case of decks running 17 lands, we've already found some evidence suggesting that the situation might not be as simple as the initial "run as many Baneslayers as you can" idea might not yield the best strategy.  It remains to be seen whether this preference for having a small number of Mulldrifters will remain once we actually run simulations that also vary the number of lands in the decks.
