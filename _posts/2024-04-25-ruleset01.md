Of course, even with our heavily restricted deck build, the decision-making process that constitutes perfect gameplay is far from obvious.  The idea behind the toolkit discussed in [the previous post](https://dpesce.github.io/banedrifter/2024/04/06/simulations.html) is that we can use it to explore different possible options for what this decision-making process might be and how it affects gameplay.

One computer-friendly approach to specifying how gameplay ought to happen is to come up with a comprehensive chain of logic by which each player is forced to abide, and then to encode that logic and simulate the resulting gameplay.  Moving forward, I'm going to refer to such a chain of logic as a "ruleset," and my plan is to try out a few of these rulesets to see what kinds of games they result in.

So let's start putting the simulation toolkit to work.

***

### Ruleset 01

For the first ruleset -- Ruleset 01 -- I am considering games in which players obey the following rules on every turn:

- If the player is able to play a land, then they will do so.
- If the player is able to play a Baneslayer Angel, then they will do so.
- If the player has no Baneslayer Angels in hand, but they have 5 mana open and a Mulldrifter, then they will usually play a Mulldrifter.  Exceptional cases include: when they have fewer than 2 cards remaining in their library.
- If the player has only 3 or 4 mana open and a Mulldrifter in hand, then they will usually evoke a Mulldrifter.  Exceptional cases include: when they have fewer than 2 cards remaining in their library.
- If the player is able to attack with a Baneslayer Angel, then they will do so.
- If the player is able to block a Baneslayer Angel with a Baneslayer Angel, then they will do so.
- The player never attacks or blocks with a Mulldrifter.
- If the player has to discard a card at the end of a turn, then they will preferentially discard the card that is most heavily-represented in their hand.  If one or more card types are tied for most heavily-represented, then the player will preferentially discard Tundra over Mulldrifter, and Mulldrifter over Baneslayer Angel.

Upon reading and digesting the above ruleset, one interesting exercise is to try to predict what kinds of outcomes games that follow this ruleset will have.  One potentially reasonable-sounding prediction might be:

> Well, because Mulldrifters can neither attack nor block, the only card that can win a game is Baneslayer Angel.  So given two decks with the same number of lands, the deck with more Baneslayer Angels will perform better.

Is this prediction correct?  We will eventually test it comprehensively, but let's first do some exploration of a single example matchup.

### Initial exploration: a single pairing

Consider two 40-card decks, each containing 17 copies of Tundra.  Player 1's deck will have 11 copies of Baneslayer Angel and 12 copies of Mulldrifter, while Player 2's deck will have 12 copies of Baneslayer Angel and 11 copies of Mulldrifter.  Using the above intuition, we would expect that Player 2 should win most often when both players are following Ruleset 01.  We can test this expectation by simulating gameplay between the two decks; let's simulate 10,000 games:

```
import banedrifter as bd
import rulesets as rs

# specify the number of games to simulate
N_games = 10000

# specify deck compositions
N_lands_player1 = 17
N_lands_player2 = 17
N_banes_player1 = 11
N_banes_player2 = 12
N_mulls_player1 = 40 - N_lands_player1 - N_banes_player1
N_mulls_player2 = 40 - N_lands_player2 - N_banes_player2

# play games in which Player 1 goes first
for i in range(N_games/2):
    d1 = bd.deck(N_banes_player1, N_mulls_player1, N_lands_player1)
    d2 = bd.deck(N_banes_player2, N_mulls_player2, N_lands_player2)
    p1 = bd.player(d1)
    p2 = bd.player(d2)
    p1, p2, winner, loss_reason = bd.play_game(p1,p2,
                                  cardplay_ruleset=rs.cardplay_01,
                                  combat_ruleset=rs.combat_01,
                                  discard_ruleset=rs.discard_01)

# play games in which Player 2 goes first
for i in range(N_games/2):
    d1 = bd.deck(N_banes_player1, N_mulls_player1, N_lands_player1)
    d2 = bd.deck(N_banes_player2, N_mulls_player2, N_lands_player2)
    p1 = bd.player(d1)
    p2 = bd.player(d2)
    p2, p1, winner, loss_reason = bd.play_game(p2,p1,
                                  cardplay_ruleset=rs.cardplay_01,
                                  combat_ruleset=rs.combat_01,
                                  discard_ruleset=rs.discard_01)
```

The results of these simulated games are summarized in the following plot:

![Matchup01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/single_matchup_01.png "Matchup01")

So the initial expectation seems to hold up, with Player 2 demonstrating a pretty decisive advantage and winning roughly 60% of all games.  But there's an interesting twist: the majority of the games are decided by milling, rather than by life total.  So the reason that Player 2 is winning most of the games is not because they have more Baneslayer Angels with which to reduce Player 1's life total, but rather because they have fewer Mulldrifters with which to mill themselves.

If milling is so prevalent in these games, then how do things change when we increase the deck size?  The plot below shows the results of another 10,000 simulated games in which each player's deck has been doubled in size, but with the proportions of each card maintained:

![Matchup02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/single_matchup_02.png "Matchup02")

Player 2 now wins roughly 70% of all games, and we can see that the relative contribution to each player's win rate from mill-based wins has substantially decreased.  However, Player 2 is still winning a majority of their games due to milling.  So how do things change as we continue to increase the deck size?  We can run some more simulations to find out:

![Deck size study](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/decksize_comparison_breakdown.png "Deck size study")

This plot is a bit busy, so let's walk through it.  The solid lines correspond to Player 1's wins, and the dashed lines correspond to Player 2's wins.  Red lines indicate wins by milling, blue lines indicate wins by life total, and gray lines indicate the overall win rate.  So for instance, if we look at the 40-card decks (all the way to the left of the plot), we can see that Player 1 has a ~40% overall win rate (solid gray line), with a bit more than 30% coming from mill-based wins (solid red line) and a bit less than 10% coming from life-total-based wins (solid blue line).  As the deck size increases, the win rates for both players stabilize at a bit below 50% for Player 1 and a bit above 50% for Player 2, with both players' win rates dominated by life-total-based wins.

So what's going on here?  How can we understand this initial rise and then fall of Player 2's win rate?

It seems to be the case that there are two regimes of relevance for these decks: a "small deck" regime in which the win rates are dominated by milling, and a "large deck" regime in which the win rates are dominated by life-total-based wins.  For Player 1's deck, the critical deck size at which it transitions from the small-deck regime to the large-deck regime is roughly 60 cards, while for Player 2 the analogous deck size is more like 90 cards.  As long as both decks are in the small-deck regime where the win rates are dominated by milling, then increasing the deck size has the effect of improving the performance of the less-mill-prone deck -- i.e., Player 2 performs better as deck size increases in this regime.  Conversely, once both decks are in the large-deck regime where the win rates are dominated by life-total-based wins, then increasing the deck size doesn't substantially change the win rates.

In the large-deck regime, we see that Player 2 wins roughly 51.3% of the time and that Player 1 wins roughly 48.7% of the time.  This difference in win rate -- about 2.6% -- almost exactly matches the 2.5% difference in the fractional number of Baneslayer Angels in each deck.  I.e., 12/40 = 30% of Player 2's deck is composed of Baneslayer Angels, while only 11/40 = 27.5% of Player 1's deck is.  It seems plausible that this 2.5% difference in the deck composition is what's driving the ~2.5% difference in win rates.  So here's a hypothesis: ***For any two decks following Ruleset 01, so long as both decks are operating in the large-deck regime then their relative win rates should match the relative fraction of each deck that is composed of Baneslayer Angels.***

Interestingly, it seems to be the case that for 40-card decks -- which are not generically in the large-deck regime -- we should expect a non-negligible fraction of games to be decided by milling.

### More extensive exploration: all 40-card decks running 17 lands

Now let's simulate more matchups.  Sticking momentarily with decks that are running 17 lands (all of which are Tundra), let's compare how all possible decks for Player 1 stack up against the same Player 2 deck as before (i.e., 12 copies of Baneslayer Angel and 11 copies of Mulldrifter):

![Winrate 1D, Nlands=17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/winrate_Nland=17_Nbane2=12.png "Winrate 1D, Nlands=17")

Here, the black curve indicates the overall win rate, with the blue and red curves showing how much of that win rate comes from life-total-based versus mill-based wins, respectively.  The highlighed red dot shows the mirror matchup, in which both decks are identical; as one would expect, the win rate for the mirror matchup is 50%.

We do see a grossly binary behavior for decks on either side of the mirror matchup: decks with more Baneslayer Angels than the mirror win more than 50% of the time, and decks with fewer Baneslayer Angels than the mirror win less than 50% of the time.  However, the win rate does not increase monotonically with the number of Baneslayer Angels in the deck.  Rather, it rises to a maximum win rate of about 92% when the deck contains 16 Baneslayer Angels but then starts decreasing, falling to a win rate of about 77% for a deck containing 23 Baneslayer Angels.  All decks containing 7 or more Baneslayer Angels predominantly win via milling.

Moving on to all 40-card decks running 17 lands, the space of matchups is now two-dimensional.  The two dimensions are (1) the number of Baneslayer Angels in Player 1's deck, and (2) the number of Baneslayer Angels in Player 2's deck.  As before case, the number of Mulldrifters will be uniquely determined for each deck once the number of Baneslayer Angels is known, because we are fixing the deck size to 40 cards and the number of lands to 17.  We can capture the space of matchups using a two-dimensional plot like so:

![Winrate 2D, Nlands=17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/winrate_2D_Nland=17.png "Winrate 2D, Nlands=17")

Each box in the grid here is colored according to the net win rate for Player 1 over 10,000 simulated games against Player 2, with each of the players wielding the decks indicated by the horizontal and vertical position of the grid cell, respectively.  A red color indicates a win rate above 50%, a blue color indicates a win rate below 50%, and white indicates a 50% win rate.  Given the setup of the horizontal and vertical axes, the mirror matches fall along the diagonal.

To determine the best-performing deck, we need to find the average win rate of each deck across all of its possible matchups.  Each row or column in the colored grid above corresponds to an appropriate set of matchups for averaging, so I've just chosen to average the columns.  The topmost panel in the figure then shows the results of these averages, which correspond to the overall win rates for each deck as a function of how many Baneslayer Angels it contains.  After averaging over all games, we find that ***the best-performing deck is the one that runs 21 Baneslayer Angels and 2 Mulldrifters.***  This deck achieves an overall win rate of about 79.2%, which is better by roughly 1.8% than the deck that runs 23 Baneslayer Angels.

So at least for the limited case of decks running 17 lands, we've already found some evidence suggesting that the simple "run as many Baneslayers as you can" idea might not yield the best strategy.  It remains to be seen whether this preference for having a small number of Mulldrifters will remain once we actually run simulations that also vary the number of lands in the decks.

We can again explore the prevalence of mill-based wins in these matchups.  Here's a plot that shows what fraction of games are decided based on milling rather than life total:

![Millrate 2D, Nlands=17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/winrate_2D_Nland=17_decomp.png "Millrate 2D, Nlands=17")

The grid here is read in the same way as the one above, but now instead of overall win rate it shows the "mill rate" for each matchup; grid cells that are colored red indicate matchups that are primarily decided by milling, grid cells that are colored blue indicate matchups that are primarily decided by life total, and grid cells that are colored white indicate matchups that are split 50/50 between mill-based and life-total-based wins.

I'm honestly not sure how to explain the detailed behavior we're seeing in this plot.  Some of the gross trends seem reasonable; e.g.:
- The highest mill rate is typically found along the diagonal, which corresponds to the mirror matchups.  This seems reasonable, if not necessarily obvious.
- A game between a deck with many Baneslayers and a deck with few Baneslayers tends to be decided by life loss rather than milling, which also seems reasonable.
But there are also aspects of this plot that I don't understand.  For instance, why does the transition between life-loss-dominated games (in blue) and mill-dominated games (in red) start out delineating a narrow band around the diagonal (towards the lower left) but then starts running nearly parallel to the coordinate axes (towards the upper right)?  This behavior results in essentially the entire upper-right corner of the grid being very mill-dominated.  And why do the upper-right-most grid cells seem to start exhibiting a reversal of this mill-dominated trend?  The very upper-right-most grid cell -- corresponding to the matchup between two decks that are both running 23 Baneslayer Angels and 17 Tundras -- is actually just ever so slightly dominated by life-total-based wins rather than by milling.  I do not know what is driving this behavior.

### An aside: only Baneslayers

The complexity of the behavior we're seeing in a deck that consists of only three different cards (Baneslayer Angel, Mulldrifter, and Tundra) makes me want to take at least a brief look at something even simpler.  Keeping everything subject to the same Ruleset 01, what if we only consider decks consisting of Baneslayer Angel and Tundra?

In this case, the 2D matchup plot looks like:

![Winrate 2D, only banes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/winrate_2D_banesonly.png "Winrate 2D, only banes")

This plot may initially look more complicated than the corresponding plot from before, but the various gross features remain pretty intuitive:
- The main diagonal again tracks the mirror matchups, so we see a 50% win rate there.
- The upper 5x5 box corresponds to the matchup in which both decks are running fewer than 5 lands.  In these matchups, neither deck is ever able to play a Baneslayer Angel, so all of them are mill-based wins whose outcome depends only on which player goes first (i.e., 50%).
- The bottom-right 1x5 strip of grid cells and the upper-left 5x1 strip correspond to matchups in which one deck is running fewer than 5 lands and the other deck is running 0 lands, again leading to a 50% mill-based win rate determined only by which player goes first.
- The remaining rightmost 5 columns of grid cells and uppermost 5 rows of grid cells correspond to matchups in which one deck is running fewer than 5 lands and the other deck is running at least 5 lands.  In these matchups, the deck running fewer than 5 lands (almost) always loses, except in rare cases towards the edges of these strips in which a small number of mill-based wins are possible.
- The rest of the grid cells correspond to more reasonable matchups (i.e., in which both decks are running playable numbers of both lands and Baneslayer Angels), and we see pretty reasonable-looking behavior.  I.e., when one deck is running more Baneslayer Angels than the other deck, it tends to perform better, up until some point when it is running too many (and thus too few lands) and then rapidly starts performing worse.
- The exact transition between what constitutes "too many" Baneslayer Angels in the first deck depends on how many Baneslayer Angels are present in the second deck; if the second deck has very Baneslayer Angels, then the first deck can get away with running a larger number of them before starting to suffer a lower win rate.

One somewhat interesting case -- interesting only because it is analytically tractable -- is when one deck is running only 1 Baneslayer Angel and the other deck has fewer than 5 lands.  In this case, the player running fewer than 5 lands is completely unable to play any Baneslayer Angels, so they can only win the game if the first player mills themselves.  But that will only happen if the first player is unable to play Baneslayer Angel in time to deal 20 damage, which takes 4 turns of attacking with it.  So if the Baneslayer Angel starts out in the bottom 4 cards of the library, and if the first player goes second (i.e., is on the draw), then they will lose the game.  The chance of the first player going second is 50%, but what is the chance that Baneslayer Angel starts out in the bottom 4 cards of the library?  Well it's simply 4/40 = 10%, because there's just one card and 40 possible slots.  So the chance that the first player wins this matchup should be 50% of 10%, which is of course 5%, which agrees well with the simulation results.

Overall, the best-performing deck runs 21 Baneslayer Angels and achieves an average win rate of about 81.7%.  However, although it achieves the highest average win rate, there are decks against which this "best" deck will consistently perform poorly; e.g., when playing against a deck that runs 24 Baneslayer Angels, this "best" deck will have a win rate of only about 45%.  This scenario actually calls into question the our definition of "best," and highlights that it is not a unique choice.  I.e., there are (at least) two reasonable-sounding -- but distinct -- definitions of what constitutes the "best" deck:
1. The best deck is the one with the highest ***average*** win rate (HAWR) across all possible matchups within the chosen format.
2. The best deck is the one whose highest ***minimum*** win rate (HMWR) across all possible matchups within the chosen format.
The best-performing deck by this second definition is actually the one that runs 24 Baneslayer Angels; there are no matchups in which this deck has a win rate worse than 50% (which occurs in the mirror matchup).

Looking at the matchup space here, I am inclined to lean more towards preferring the second definition of "best" than the first.  After all, in real life most people would not ever bother running a good chunk of the decks in this space (e.g., the ones with a very lopsided ratio of lands to Baneslayers), and so the performance metric that averages over all matchups contains substantial contributions from a some possible-in-principle but unlikely-in-practice decks.  Whereas the second performance metric actually speaks to something that remains relevant in the likely-to-be-played region of the space; i.e., it seeks to minimize the worst-case performance.

We can also take a look at the 2D mill-rate plot:

![Millrate 2D, only banes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/winrate_2D_banesonly_decomp.png "Millrate 2D, only banes")

This plot seems easier to understand than the corresponding version from when we had both Baneslayers and Mulldrifters in the deck.  Other than the games that involve decks with either all lands or fewer than 5 lands, the only matchups that show a substantial fraction of mill-based wins are concentrated along the mirror matchup diagonal.

### Comprehensive exploration: all 40-card decks

Moving on to all 40-card decks, the space of matchups is now four-dimensional.  The four dimensions are (1) the number of Baneslayer Angels in Player 1's deck, (2) the number of Baneslayer Angels in Player 2's deck, (3) the number of Mulldrifters in Player 1's deck, and (4) the number of Mulldrifters in Player 2's deck.  Once the number of Baneslayer Angels and the number of Mulldrifters for a particular deck are specified, the number of lands is also uniquely known because we are fixing the total deck size to 40 cards.  Using the expressions derived in [a previous post](https://dpesce.github.io/banedrifter/2024/04/03/counting.html), we can determine that the total number of unique decks is 861 and the total number of unique matchups is 371,091.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to plot a 4-dimensional space.  I even struggle to plot things in three dimensions in a way that's easy to parse visually.  So I'd like to keep plotting things using at most two dimensions, which means that the information is going to have to get compressed somehow.  Some of the plots that we've been looking at in the sections above are essentially 2-dimensional slices of the full 4-dimensional space explored here, so that's one way to get a partial look at things.  But another way is simple concatenation; i.e., we can just list all 861 unique decks using some particular ordering, and then make the same 2D plot of each deck's matchup against each other deck as before.  For lack of anything that would be obviously better, I've chosen to order the decks as follows:

- Deck #1 has 0 Baneslayer Angel(s), 0 Mulldrifter(s), and 40 Tundra(s)
- Deck #2 has 0 Baneslayer Angel(s), 1 Mulldrifter(s), and 39 Tundra(s)
- Deck #3 has 0 Baneslayer Angel(s), 2 Mulldrifter(s), and 38 Tundra(s)
- $\vdots$
- Deck #41 has 0 Baneslayer Angel(s), 40 Mulldrifter(s), and 0 Tundra(s)
- Deck #42 has 1 Baneslayer Angel(s), 0 Mulldrifter(s), and 39 Tundra(s)
- Deck #43 has 1 Baneslayer Angel(s), 1 Mulldrifter(s), and 38 Tundra(s)
- $\vdots$
- Deck #81 has 1 Baneslayer Angel(s), 39 Mulldrifter(s), and 0 Tundra(s)
- Deck #82 has 2 Baneslayer Angel(s), 0 Mulldrifter(s), and 38 Tundra(s)
- Deck #83 has 2 Baneslayer Angel(s), 1 Mulldrifter(s), and 37 Tundra(s)
- $\vdots$
- Deck #859 has 39 Baneslayer Angel(s), 0 Mulldrifter(s), and 1 Tundra(s)
- Deck #860 has 39 Baneslayer Angel(s), 1 Mulldrifter(s), and 0 Tundra(s)
- Deck #861 has 40 Baneslayer Angel(s), 0 Mulldrifter(s), and 0 Tundra(s)

When ordered in this way, the 2-dimensional win rate plot looks like:

![Winrate 2D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/winrate_2D.png "Winrate 2D")

And the corresponding mill rate plot looks like:

![Millrate 2D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpesce/banedrifter/ruleset01/banedrifter/plots/ruleset01/millrate_2D.png "Winrate 2D")

We can pretty clearly see lots of little chunks of these plots that correspond to decks with a constant number of Baneslayer Angels (since that number represents the outermost index in the triple "loop" that the selected ordering performs).  Because the first of these chunks contains zero Baneslayer Angels, games that follow Ruleset 01 can only be decided by milling, which is why the lower-leftmost corner of the mill rate plot is fully red.  It's possible to spend a lot of time staring at these plots and identifying many little regions that correspond to understandable matchups.  And it's also possible to try other sorting strategies (e.g., sorting by overall winrate, by average mana cost, by number of Baneslayers, etc.) to see if anything looks noticeably better than the one above.

But I can't say that I recommend doing any of that.

Instead, let's just cut to the chase.  The deck with the highest average win rate (HAWR) runs 19 Baneslayer Angels, 2 Mulldrifters, and 19 Tundras, achieving a win rate of 93% when averaged across all matchups.  But amazingly, the deck with the highest minimum win rate (HMWR) remains the one that runs 24 Baneslayer Angels, 0 Mulldrifters, and 16 Tundras; it again achieves a minimum win rate of 50%, in the mirror matchup.  Against the HMWR deck, the HAWR deck only wins about 32.5% of the time.

So I think we've made a small amount of headway on the original question, and I'm happy adopting HMWR as a working definition of "best" for now.  To summarize: when following Ruleset 01, and when restricting the card options to just Baneslayer Angel, Mulldrifter, and Tundra, the best-performing deck is the one that runs 24 Baneslayer Angels, 0 Mulldrifters, and 16 Tundras.
